# luda

ludicrously awesome [w]rapper for nvidia-docker


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: [coming shortly]

```
pip install luda
```

Note: On a Mac, you will need to install this somewhere else besides
`/usr/local/` because of Docker's restrictions on touching the host OS.

```
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/ryanolson/luda.git
cd luda
pip install -e .
```


## Features

* Opinionated wrapper for `docker`/`nvidia-docker` designed to provide
  Singularity-like functionality to Docker images.

* Best used for container images that run DL/HPC-like jobs, not suited
  for long-running daemons or services that require root.

* Volume mounts a /bootstrap volume and overrides the container image
  `ENTRYPOINT` to map the host USER, UID and GID [future work] into the
  container.  Current the docker commandline is echo'ed to the terminal on
  container startup.

* Automounts the current working directory on the host to `/work` inside
  the container.  `/work` becomes the current working directory inside the
  running container. `--work` can be used to specify an alternative default
  working directory for use inside the container; it will be mounted to `/work`.

* Automounts `$HOME` on the host to `/home/$USER` inside the container.
  `--home` option.k


## Use Cases

  * Bootstrapping Images
  * Support for nvidia-docker-compose (awesome!)
  * Improved Volume Mounting
  * Docker Passthru
  * X11 Passthru


### Improved Volume Mounting

Volume shorthand works similarily to the Docker command with a few additions.
Noteably, the host path can be relative, and if no container path, the basename
of the host path is used to mount to the root directory, e.g. -v logs` is
equivalent to `-v $PWD/logs:/logs`.

```
luda -v logs nvidia/cuda:8.0-devel

# readonly variant
luda -v logs::ro nvidia/cuda:8.0-devel
```

Thanks to [Deni Bertovic's
blog](https://denibertovic.com/posts/handling-permissions-with-docker-volumes/).
`luda` provides very similar functionality but does not require specially
crafted base images and wraps the details of the docker command-line.
